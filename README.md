# Gerix WiFi Cracker 2018
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## NOTE: 
This tool has been re-written to run on Kali (2018.1)

## DEPENDENCIES:
apt-get install qt4-dev-tools

## TODO:
- Add a updater for the tool.
- Add a WPS tab + support for WPS cracking (Reaver / Bully, or support for both)
- Consider renaming the project?
- Change deprecated "iwconfig" with the use of "iw"
- Consider adding "hashcat" GPU cracking option.
- WPA handshake capture is slow, considering enhancement to it.
  wifite2 got a VERY FAST handshake capturing method, consider using that code.

- Fix new graphics.

## LAUNCH:

To launch the program use:
$ python gerix.py

Enjoy!


NOTE:
For copy and paste in xterm windows you can use the shortcuts CTRL-INS
and SHIFT-INS.
In alternative, you can select the text with the mouse, and use the third
button of the mouse to paste it. On a laptop you can emulate the third button
pressing the first and the second button together.
