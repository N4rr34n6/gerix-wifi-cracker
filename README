-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#NOTE: 
This tool has been re-written to run on Kali (2018.1)

#DEPENDENCIES:
apt-get install qt4-dev-tools

#TODO:
- Go through the old code, fix indentation and other stuff (W.I.P)
- Add a WPS tab + support for WPS cracking (Reaver / Bully, or support for both)

#LAUNCH:

To launch the program use:
$ python gerix.py

Enjoy!


NOTE:
For copy and paste in xterm windows you can use the shortcuts CTRL-INS
and SHIFT-INS.
In alternative, you can select the text with the mouse, and use the third
button of the mouse to paste it. On a laptop you can emulate the third button
pressing the first and the second button together.
